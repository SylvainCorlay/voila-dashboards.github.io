**Tech**

**Jupyter client**

* Workaround in jupyter_client. When spawning multiple kernels at once (~20 kernels), the probability to get a "ZMQError - address already in use" was quite high. This workaround reduces this probability by making sure two kernels don't get assigned the same communication ports.
    * issue: https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/issues/487
    * workaround: https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/pull/490
    * Kevin Bates would like this new behaviour to be disabled optionally with a flag (adding the flag is required for the next jupyter_server release).

**Voila templates**

* conda package for voila-material template 
    * repo: https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila-material
    * PR: https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/9852
    * recipe: https://github.com/conda-forge/voila-material-feedstock

*  Vuetify template examples by Robert Seidl: https://github.com/seidlr/voila-vuetify-template-examples
*  Template cookiecutter by Aart Goossens: https://github.com/aartgoossens/voila-template-cookiecutter

**Jupyter Server**

* Voted (among a smaller group) on adoption of Jupyter Server in multiple frontends. 
    * Positive agreement!
    * See [notes](https://hackmd.io/Wmz_wjrLRHuUbgWphjwRWw) from the Jupyter Server meeting.
* Also voted on what do to with jupyter/notebook.
    * Mixed feelings, but generally agreed to move notebook to depend on jupyter_server
    * See [notes](https://hackmd.io/Wmz_wjrLRHuUbgWphjwRWw) from the Jupyter Server meeting.
* Developing process for migration.
    * I can only budget ~20% of my time right now, so it's moving slowly.
