# Voil√† Weekly Meeting

## 2019 / 12 / 09

*Attendees*

- Jeremy Tuloup
- Sylvain Corlay
- Vidar Tonaas Fauske

### Updates

**Tech**

 - Lengthy discussion on whether a gridstack-based template system should be further developed instead of the current plan of using the PhosphorJS/Lumino dockarea.
    - Gridstack is a reather small dependency and short codebase.
    - It is more rigid and mobile-friendly than the dockarea which is more amenable to desktop IDEs.
    - Open issue https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1084 on the question of dropping JQuery and JQueryUI in GridStackJS. Modernizing the Gridstack codebase and hooking up Phosphor/Lumino layout system will be a requirement.
